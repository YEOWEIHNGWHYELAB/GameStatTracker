# GameStatTracker

This app is mainly used for viewing the Game Statistics that you have and perform CRUD operations on a small scale. It should be used with another automation app that can use API calls to automatically insert Game Statistics into the app, because it is quite painful to have to key in the game data. Hopefully the game you want to track has API for you retrieve so as to insert Game Statistics into the app.
